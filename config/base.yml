AllCops:
  # When the Ruby community, via RuboCop, adopts a new standard
  #   (with additional filtering by standard.rb) it is good enough for us!
  # However, the new standard needs to be explicitly enabled by one of the filtering gems:
  #   - standard
  # NOTE: New cops can also be enabled higher up the dependency chain, such as in:
  #   - rubocop-lts
  #   - rubocop-ruby*_*
  NewCops: disable
